# TrailingDigits
We all know that when the majority of the trailing digits are "9," consumers are much more likely to purchase goods. So I've created a project that shows how many times the digit "9" has been trailed in order to attract more customers and sell more products.
Software requirements:
➢ Dev C++
Hardware requirements
➢ Processor Intel i5/i7
➢ RAM min 8GB
➢ Hard disk min 16GB
Below is the test case 1
1.Price of the given doodad (b):57 Range: (1<=b<100000)
2. Desired trailing digit (d): 9
3. Maximum price of bundle (a):=1000 Range: (b<=a<10000000)
